# Fray

The fray app is a window based system tray built for Linux / Unix using the FYne toolkit.

It makes use of the [FyneDesk](https://github.com/fyne-io/fynedesk) system tray module.
It does not support legacy system tray apps, only those updated to the more recent AppIndicator DBus spec.

This project is in early development and may have issues, particularly regarding menus.
